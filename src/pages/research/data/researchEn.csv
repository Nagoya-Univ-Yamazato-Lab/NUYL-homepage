Tang",Theoretical modeling and interference prevention of light trails for LED propeller based image sensor communication,IEICE Communications Express,"A propeller LED transmitter(P-Tx) further boosts image sensor communication (ISC) throughput by mounting LEDs on a rotating arm and encoding data via their On/Off state. Reducing the angular interval per bit increases data rate but also raises the risk of overlapping "light trails" and ensuing interference. To date, no analytical model has linked the control angle to inter-trail interference in P-Tx-based ISC. This paper proposes a fundamental model of light trail generation and blinking control conditions to prevent interference between adjacent light trails. In the proposed model, the luminous energy distribution on the image plane is calculated based on the LED rotation trajectory. We also provide preliminary experimental results to validate the proposed model.",Dec. 2025,,,

By exploiting the row-wise exposure characteristic of rolling shutter sensors, rapidly blinking LED signals appear as stripe patterns within the captured images, enabling the efficient extraction of trans mitted data. To further improve the transmission rate, we im plement offset unary encoding, which utilizes code length rather than absolute brightness to enhance resistance to ambient noise. In addition, a cyclic shift technique is introduced to minimize average transmission time by cyclically rotating quaternary symbols and selecting the most compact arrangement. The system also incorporates a localized image analysis procedure that isolates the LED region, reducing the impact of background interference. Field experiments conducted in a controlled test environment demonstrated reliable communication at speeds of up to 60 km/h, with accurate data transmission under those specific conditions, suggesting the approach's potential for higher-speed operations. The use of standard automotive camera sensors and cost-effective LED devices highlights the practicality of this solution. Overall, the proposed system can serve as an efficient, low-cost, and easily deployable platform for future V2X applications, enhancing connectivity in intelligent transportation systems.",Nov. 2025,,,

However, when optical spots become blurred and spatially overlapped due to focal shift, resolution limitations, or interference, severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) occurs, significantly degrading decoding performance. Existing methods mitigate ISI by reducing LED transmission signaling density.

This paper proposes a robust decoding framework that maintains full LED signaling density. We introduce a pilot-aided geometric recognition with a PSF-constrained Hough transform and circle center alignment refinement. By leveraging prior structural knowledge from pilot frames, the system effectively separates overlapping LED signals under severe optical distortion.

Experimental results on a real-world VLC testbed confirm that the proposed method achieves superior decoding accuracy and throughput compared to conventional Hough-based and low-density baseline methods. The results highlight its potential for high-efficiency VLC applications in interference-prone environments.

However, conventional performance evaluation based on the Monte Carlo method is computationally intensive, especially for low Bit Error Rate (BER) regions, and offers limited intuitive insight into how system parameters affect performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid analytical method. This approach combines a deterministic physical simulation to model Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) with a theoretical analysis using the Q-function for probabilistic noise effects. Our model is based on the key finding that system performance is dominated by ISI from the two immediately adjacent light trails. The BER characteristics derived from our method show good agreement with results from the Monte Carlo simulation, validating our approach. This technique significantly reduces computational load and clarifies the relationship between design parameters and BER, enabling efficient system optimization.",Oct. 2025,,,

In particular, sensor fusion plays a crucial role in autonomous driving systems. However, equipping vehicles with multiple sensors leads to increased costs, making it necessary to have a single sensor that can perform multiple roles. This study focuses on event cameras, exploring their potential among various sensor technologies. Event cameras possess characteristics such as high dynamic range, low latency, and high temporal resolution, and they can also leverage visible light communication. This enables high visibility in low-light and backlit environments, as well as excellent performance in detecting pedestrian movements and acquiring traffic information between traffic lights and vehicles. These characteristics are particularly beneficial for autonomous driving systems. Additionally, if distance estimation functionality can be provided by the event camera, it allows a single sensor to perform multiple roles, offering significant advantages in terms of cost efficiency. In this study, we achieved distance estimation based on triangulation using an event camera and two points on an LED bar installed along a road. Furthermore, by employing the phase-only correlation method, we achieved sub-pixel precision in estimating the distance between two points on the LED bar, enabling even more accurate distance estimation. This approach performed monocular distance estimation in outdoor driving environments at distances ranging from 20 to 60 meters, achieving a success
rate of over 90 % with errors of less than 0.5 meters. We are considering implementing position estimation in the future, with the current distance estimation technology forming the foundation for this. By achieving high-precision distance estimation, the vehicle's position relative to surrounding ITS smart poles can be accurately determined, enabling more precise position estimation. This will allow autonomous vehicles to know their exact position in real-time and select the optimal driving route based on surrounding traffic conditions and road conditions. Ultimately, we believe that this technology can contribute to the development of a smart transportation system in the city.",Jun. 2025,,,

(ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), sensors that serve as the "eyes" for sensing the vehicle's surrounding environment are essential. Traditionally, image sensors and LiDAR have played this role. However, a new type of vision sensor, event cameras, has recently attracted attention. Event cameras respond to changes in the surrounding environment (e.g., motion), exhibit strong robustness against motion blur, and perform well in high dynamic range environments, which are desirable in robotics applications. Furthermore, the asynchronous and low-latency principles of data acquisition make event cameras suitable for optical communication. By adding communication functionality to event cameras, it becomes possible to utilize I2V communication to immediately share information about forward collisions, sudden braking, and road conditions, thereby contributing to hazard avoidance. Additionally, receiving information such as signal timing and traffic volume enables speed adjustment and optimal route selection, facilitating more efficient driving. In this study, we construct a vehicle visible light communication system where event cameras are receivers, and multiple LEDs are transmitters.In driving scenes, the system tracks the transmitter positions and separates densely packed LED light sources using pilot sequences based on Walsh-Hadamard codes. As a result, outdoor vehicle experiments demonstrate error-free communication under conditions where the transmitter-receiver distance was within 40 meters and the vehicle's driving speed was 30 km/h (8.3 m/s).",Jun. 2025,,,

They use every unique light-emitting diode (LED) on roads for data transmission and range estimation. The simultaneous VLC and ranging can be applied to improve the performance of both. It is necessary to achieve rapid data rate and high-accuracy ranging when transmitting VLC data and estimating the range simultaneously. We use the signal modulation method of pulse-width modulation (PWM) to increase the data rate. However, when using PWM for VLC data transmission, images of the LED transmitters are captured at different luminance levels and are easily saturated, and LED saturation leads to inaccurate range estimation. In this paper, we establish a novel simultaneous visible light communication and ranging system for ITS using PWM. Here, we analyze the LED saturation problems and apply bicubic interpolation to solve the LED saturation problem and thus, improve the communication and ranging performance. Simultaneous communication and ranging are enabled using a stereo camera. Communication is realized using maximal-ratio combining (MRC) while ranging is achieved using phase-only correlation (POC) and sinc function approximation.

The proposed method iteratively creates the short-term power delay profile while lowering the threshold which distinguishes between signal and noise. The purpose of the threshold is to suppress the noise in each profile and to extract the effective multipath components. Furthermore, the method aligns and averages the phase of each instantaneous delay profile. In this way, only the noise component can be reduced while maintaining a high multipath power. As a result, we successfully reduced the noise power by 15 dB by analyzing the raw data of 200 instantaneous delay profiles measured in the 50 MHz bands at 3.35 GHz.

In order to design efficient cell configurations for HAPS-based services, we need radio wave propagation models that consider various factors of vegetation, terrain, urban-suburban areas, and building entry loss. This paper focuses on propagation loss at high-elevation angles in urban and suburban areas. Recommendation ITU-R (International Telecommunication Union Radio communication sector) P.2108-1 describes the clutter loss model, which is the propagation loss caused by features such as buildings. The applicable frequency for ITU-R P.2108-1 is above 10 GHz; however, this model has no parameters for urban structure. Therefore, it needs to consider a correction for an urban structure to precisely evaluate clutter loss. We propose a new model that corrects Recommendation ITU-R P.2108 using shielding building heights as the urban structure. Since this new model was created based on measurements from 0.7 GHz to 5.7 GHz, the applicable frequencies are from 0.7 GHz to 5.7 GHz. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm whether the model applies to frequencies above 5.7 GHz. This paper compares the results of new propagation measurements at 29.3 GHz using a helicopter with the predicted results of the proposed model.

This study focuses on optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in a rolling shutter based VLC for further high-speed data rates. Because an image sensor is employed, conventional optical OFDM, such as DC-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM), must fit in the grayscale range of 0–255 levels. Therefore, DCO-OFDM suffers from poor error performance owing to its high PAPR. To address this problem, we propose a polarity-separated transmission, in which the bipolar OFDM signal is separated into positive and negative parts and then transmitted by two LEDs simultaneously. Polarity-separated transmission is expected to double the grayscale range, i.e. 0–511, and improve error performance because it reconstructs the original bipolar signal by combining the received signals from two LEDs. We experimentally demonstrate and compare the symbol error rate (SER) performance of DCO-OFDM and polarity-separated transmissions. Consequently, polarity-separated transmission improved the SER performance by 10– 2 in the fundamental frequency range of 300–700 Hz when 16-PSK was adopted for subcarrier modulation.",May 2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181518,,

Conventional camera-based VLC suffers from low data rates and high latency due to the limited camera frame rates. To solve this problem, the event camera has been used as the receiver in VLC. Event cameras detect changes in brightness and asynchronously output these changes as events in microsecond order. The high temporal resolution gives the event camera-based VLC good potential in terms of high speed and low latency. However, when an event camera is used as the VLC receiver, the light of the transmitter needs to be changed constantly. If the transmitter LED is continuously in the same blinking state, the event camera may not output any events and the data could not be recovered until the blinking state changes. To transmit the optical signal for event cameras, we use a propeller-type rotary LED transmitter for the event camera-based VLC. The transmitter rotates the blinking LED in circles and uses the afterimage of LED light to transmit signals. The event camera detects the afterimages and constantly outputs them as a stream of events. We filter the noise events and recover data using signal events. This study verifies the operation for the proposed system through an implementation experiment. As a result, we achieved the communication in the proposed system and provided a basic evaluation in terms of communication speed and quality.",May 2022,,,

The rotary LED transmitter was developed to increase the data rate of ISC using afterimages of LED lights. The transmitter simultaneously causes the LEDs to blink and rotates them around a vertical axis. Owing to the movement of the blinking LEDs that occurs within the exposure time of the camera, multiple blinking states are captured as afterimages, thus increasing the amount of information that can be received per image. However, with increasing communication distance, the size of the LED light captured on the image sensor decreases. In this case, it is difficult to distinguish each LED blinking state, leading to a degradation of the demodulation performance. To overcome this problem, the proposed STC encodes adjacent angular afterimages as symbol pairs and transmits these symbol pairs using two symbol times. In addition, we simplified the data decoding process by using normalized LED luminance values. We evaluate the demodulation performance of the proposed method through experiments. Compared with conventional coding methods, the proposed STC requires no channel estimation and significantly improves the demodulation performance.",Feb. 2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3137601,,

In previous research, LEO-MIMO communication requires control signals to estimate the Doppler frequencies of each satellite. The control signal is allocated a different frequency band to avoid inter-carrier interference with other signals. However, as the number of communication LEO satellites increases, the bandwidth of the control signal becomes wider and the bandwidth for the MIMO signal becomes narrower. In other words, the problem is that the capacity of LEO-MIMO decreases with the increase in the number of communication LEO satellites. Therefore, this study attempts to suppress the communication capacity reduction by superimposing control signals. This technique can improve the bandwidth of the control signal is constant regardless of the number of satellites, and suppress capacity reduction regardless the number of satellites. On the other hands, superimposed control signals technique degrades the Doppler frequency estimation accuracy due to inter-carrier interference. To tackle of the problem, we propose the novel Doppler frequency estimation using Deep learning techniques.

The superposition of the control signals occupy only a frequency bandwidth of one control signal, thus can prevent the capacity reduction. A challenge is how to estimate each satellites’ Doppler frequency from the superimposed control signal.

Communication in this scheme depends on the quality of images transmitted from the LED to the sensor. If the image becomes unfocused on the way to the receiver, the LED luminance that make up the signal cannot be detected, so the receiver cannot demodulate the signal data. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a novel demodulation scheme to recover data from a degraded image, based on a maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) algorithm. The proposed method creates template images that imitate all possible blinking patterns produced by the LED transmitter, and then calculates the Euclidean distances between pixels in the captured image and the pseudo images for all possible blinking patterns. Finally, the algorithm chooses the image template with the smallest Euclidian distance from the received signal as the recovered data. Though an exhaustive set of image templates must be prepared for the proposed MLD, the number of templates depends on the number of LEDs on the transmitter. Thus, the computational complexity of this method increases as the number of transmitter LEDs increases. To reduce the computational complexity of the proposed MLD algorithm, the binary differential evolution (BDE) algorithm is used, which is a swarm intelligence technique.

This results in the lower performance of SR receivers in comparison with linear receivers. Employing a parallel network of SR systems is expected to solve this problem. The present theoretical analysis demonstrates that in a certain noise intensity range, the output of the network can fully describe an input sub-threshold signal, and hence, the performance close to that of the linear receivers can be obtained. The effectiveness of the SR receiver was also demonstrated through a numerical example of the bit error rate (BER).

We show that the nonlinear signal processing dramatically improves the detectability of the weak signal, supported by an interference signal generated by an appropriate beam control of the antenna arrays. The method takes advantage of subthreshold signal detection by the Stochastic resonance. To postulate a performance of the interference-aided detection, we numerically evaluate the channel capacity provided by the proposed diversity reception on a fading model. Through the numerical analysis, we find that the channel capacity depends on the threshold level of the detector and also the beam pattern determined by the diversity weights in the antenna arrays.",Sep. 2018,,,

The challenge is the detection of weak (subthreshold) signals, the level of which is less than the detection limit of radio receivers. To understand the theory underlying the mechanism in the presented diversity scheme, we introduce an analytic model of a dual polarized antenna array in the fading channel. In addition, the channel capacity in a binary data transmission is derived. As a result, we reveal that the interference-aided diversity reception enables us to detect signals even below the detection limit of the receiver. Moreover, the appropriate source code is needed to achieve the channel capacity because the transmission channel is asymmetric in the present reception scheme.",Sep. 2018,"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2851583,28616",,
T. Yamazato,Image Sensor Communications for Automotive,"Progress In Electromagnetics Research Symposium (PIERS), Toyama International Conference Center, Toyama, Japan","This article introduces image sensor communications (ISC), a subset of visible light communication (VLC), that use high-speed image sensor and its application to automotive. Li-Fi (light fidelity) and OCC (optical camera communication) or also know as CamCom are also VLC family. Li-Fi is a high-speed wireless system and is currently in the process of being standardized in IEEE 802.11. The OCC uses an ordinary camera, e.g. a smartphone camera, as a receiver while ISC uses a high-speed image sensor as a reception device.  The principal component of a camera, an image sensor, is used for both ISC and OCC. The main difference is that ISC focuses on a high-speed image sensor while OCC concentrates on low-cost consumer applications using smartphones and similar contemporary devices. For automotive usage, a high-speed image sensor is the best choice for the VLC receiver because the image sensor has a spatial separation of noise and target source. The VLC family uses LED as the transmitter and LED light sources are everywhere on streets: in signs, traffic lights, street lights, and other stationary objects. So if we can send IDs or exact location data (latitude and longitude) by way of VLC from those LEDs, then they can be used as anchor nodes placed on roads, sidewalks, or landmarks. Those anchor nodes help autonomous cars and connected vehicle for robust navigation with centimeter accuracy. The image sensor is the suitable detection device as it can be used for both positioning and VLC data detection. The author has been working on ISC for automotive applications. In this article, some of the author research, as well as his findings, are introduced.",Aug. 2018,,,

Our goal in this study is to develop a precise tracking method. To accomplish this, vehicle vibration modeling and its parameters estimation, i.e., representative frequencies and their amplitudes for inherent vehicle vibration, and the variance of the Gaussian random process representing road surface irregularity, are required. In this paper, we measured actual vehicle vibration in a driving situation and determined parameters based on the frequency characteristics. Then, we demonstrate that vehicle vibration that induces transmitter displacement in an image plane can be modeled by only Gaussian random processes that represent road surface irregularity when a high frame rate (e.g., 1000 fps) image sensor is used as an ISC receiver.

In practice, the symbol rate of this paper is R/(m + 1) because a guard slot is inserted every m slots. In the superimposed system, N data streams where the symbol rate of the nth data stream, n = {1, 2, . . . , N}, is 1/(m + 1)n-1 times the symbol rate of the first data stream are combined to form a pulse-width modulated (PWM) wave with a period time T. An IS receiver with a camera operating at a frame rate of R/(m + 1)n-1 fps demodulates data streams whose symbol rate is R/m + 1)n symbol/s or lower.

Currently, 55 000 UTMS infrared beacon systems have been installed, and they provide expressway and ordinary road information to cars. However, the data rate is 1 Mbps, and a faster data rate is necessary to support automotive and smart mobility devices. In this paper, we propose an uplink V2I system for the UTMS. The system is designed to match the current beacon system as closely as possible, so that the system can easily be replaced and still provide sufficient bandwidth for future automotive and smart mobility devices. We adopt a photo diode (PD) as the VLC receiver and a commercially available off-the-shelf LED headlight as a transmitter. Unfortunately, the bandwidth of such an LED is usually small, so we consider applying a bit-loading algorithm to direct-current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. To reduce strong background noise, such as from the sun, we narrow down the field-of-view by applying a lens to the PD, which forms a tiny communication area, smaller than the current infrared beacon system.

Toward the future in which vehicles are connected anytime and anywhere by optical signals, the cutting-edge camera receiver employing a special CMOS image sensor, i.e., the optical communication image sensor (OCI), has been prototyped, and an optical V2V communication system applying this OCI-based camera receiver has already demonstrated 10-Mb/s optical signal transmission between real vehicles during outside driving.

In this paper, we describe and provide results for modeling image sensor based VLC for automotive applications. In particular, we examine the channel model for mobile movements in the image plane as well as channel decay according to the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Optical flow measurements were conducted for three VLC situations for automotive use: infrastructure to vehicle VLC (I2V-VLC); vehicle to infrastructure VLC (V2I- VLC); and vehicle to vehicle VLC (V2V-VLC). We describe vehicle motion by optical flow with subpixel accuracy using phase-only correlation (POC) analysis and show that a single-pinhole camera model successfully describes these three VLC cases. In addition, the luminance of the central pixel from the projected LED area versus the distance between the LED and the camera was measured. Our key findings are twofold. First, a single-pinhole camera model can be applied to vehicle motion modeling of a I2V-VLC, V2I-VLC, and V2V-VLC. Second, the DC gain at a pixel remains constant as long as the projected image of the transmitter LED occupies several pixels.

Particularly, an image sensor based OWC systems consist of the LED transmitters and camera receivers are expected to contribute to intelligent transport system (ITS) for driving supports. For high achievable data rates, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based OWC systems have attracted a great deal of attention. Despite attractive features of optical OFDM, only few attempts have so far been made to adopt it as a modulation scheme of an image sensor based OWC system. There remains a need for an evaluation of adopting an optical OFDM to the image sensor based OWC systems. Another important issue needs to be addressed is the performance degradation due to a frequency response of an actual image sensor device, especially a signal attenuation loss in higher frequency. In addition to such loss, a narrow band noise generated by its circuits also degrades the performance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate BER performances of the optical-OFDM using an actual image sensor device, the optical communication image sensor (OCI). From simulation results, it is found that the frequency response and the narrowband noise at 12MHz of the OCI lead to the significant reduction of BER performances.

The M-ary modulation scheme can transmit b-bit data at a time by using M=2b distinct sequences. In order to generate M distinct sequences and recover b-bit data, the proposed system separates the chaotic dynamics having the chaotic sequence by using M interleavers, and reconstructs the original sequence based on the chaotic dynamics from the separated one by using M deinterleavers. In advance, each data symbol among M symbols is allocated to each interleaver-deinterleaver pair. The transmitter selects an interleaver corresponding to a data symbol and separates the order of samples of the chaotic sequence using the selected interleaver. The receiver feeds the received sequence into all M deinterleavers and outputs M reconstructed sequences. The proposed system can reconstruct the original chaotic sequence only when the correct deinterleaver, which becomes paired with the interleaver, is selected.

LEDs are extremely energy-efficient and predicted to become widespread in general lighting application.  Because LED is a solid-state lighting device, it can be modulated at high-speed compared with other lighting sources.  VLC uses LEDs, which send data by flashing light at speeds undetectable to the human eye.Widespread use of LEDs in traffic applications and growing interest in Intelligent Transport System (ITS) presents an opportunity for VLC.  Data transmission using LED traffic lights, LED road illumination, and LED brake lights are typical application. In this paper, an on-going research, road-to-vehicle visible light communication, will be introduced.  The LED array, assumed to be an LED traffic light, is used as a transmitter and it sends data to a moving vehicle.

So as to improve the transmission reliability, an error correcting code like a low-density parity-check (LDPC) is applied to the road-to-vehicle VLC system. The decoder of the LDPC code needs channel information in order to maximize decoding performance. Usually, it is calculated from a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or bit error rate (BER) of a channel, where noise is a dominant factor of the channel characteristic. In the road-to-vehicle VLC system, not noise but interference among LEDs decides the channel characteristic.

The proposed method estimates a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) from the receiving image, and calculates the channel information using the SIR. The proposed method is evaluated by experiment.

The traffic light is composed of a hundred of LEDs on two dimensional plain. In this system, data is sent as two dimensional brightness patterns by controlling each LED of the traffic light individually, and they are received as images by the camera. Here, there are problems that neighboring LEDs on the received image are merged due to less number of pixels in case that the receiver is distant from the transmitter, and/or due to blurring by defocus of the camera. Because of that, bit error rate (BER) increases due to recognition error of intensity of LEDs To solve the problem, we propose a method that estimates the intensity of LEDs by solving the inverse problem of communication channel characteristic from the transmitter to the receiver.

Our previous method is performed by using a chaotic sequence generated according to the chaotic dynamics. In this case, it is very difficult to recover data without a successive sequence based on the chaotic dynamics. We focus on this feature and consider that an improved method separates and reconstructs the chaotic dynamics of the sequence according to a specific rule. Namely, the separation and reconstruction of the chaotic dynamics can be applied for our improved method as additional information. As results of simulations, we have confirmed that the advantage gained in BER performance of our improved method is about 2&#8211;2.5 dB compared to a conventional method (without coding).",Oct. 2012,,,

Besides reducing the energy consumptions of the clusters, it is necessary to make the clusters achieve equal lifetimes so that the whole network can survive longer. In this paper, we focus on the cluster lifetimes in multi-hop WSNs with cooperative multi-input single-output scheme. With a simplified model of multi-hop WSNs, we change the transmission schemes, the sizes and transmission distances of clusters to investigate their effects on the cluster lifetimes.

In cooperative transmission, energy consumption is balanced among the nodes because of the use of another node as a relay for data transmission of distant nodes. The conventional scheme to select a relay node is based on available battery energy and the expectation of energy consumption of each node.

Conventionally, the hierarchical coding has been realized through the wavelet transform that has a limitation of number and disposition of LEDs, and as a result it does not always match with the design of the transmitters (e.g. traffic lights, etc.) used in real life. To solve the limitation problem, we propose a more flexible way of designing the application of LEDs depending on the transmitters. In particular, overlay coding is realized through the procedures of coding and decoding. In coding, we replace one LED with a flexible number of LEDs, and the number depends on whether the data is high-priority or low-priority, then high-priority data and low-priority data are overlaid. In decoding, we first obtain the high-priority data, and then the low-priority data using retrieved high-priority data.

"T. Yamazato, S. Haruyama",[Tutorial]  Visible Light Communications,"IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), Kyoto, Japan","Visible light communications (VLC) is the latest optical wireless communications technologies that uses low-power light emitting diodes, or LEDs, not only to provide light but also to broadcast data. LEDs are extremely energy-efficient and predicted to become widespread in general lighting application. It is expected that LED market will reach $29 billion in 2017 that is comparable to today's NAND and DRAM markets [1]. Because LED is a solid-state lighting device, it can be modulated at high-speed compared with other lighting sources. VLC uses LEDs, which send data by flashing light at speeds undetectable to the human eye. The pioneer of VLC using LEDs is Professor Masao Nakagawa of Keio University. His first paper on this subject appeared in the early 2000, together with his successor Prof. Shinichiro Haruyama, the instructor of this tutorial. Later in 2003, he formed Visible Light Communication Consortium (VLCC). Now VLCC is lead by Prof. Haruyama. Please see the following video, an interview of Prof. Haruyama about VLC, which has been broadcast by NHK World in June 4, 2009. http://www.naka-lab.jp/movie/nhk_world.wmv So far various experimental VLC systems and prototypes are demonstrated. Such includes 4.8kbps visible light ID as an infrastructure to mobile-terminal application, independent sound transmission through RGB visible lights and 100Mbps VLC wireless LAN system. Using LED array, the data rate of 1 Gbps achieved by Keio University (Prof. Haruyama) that is the fastest at the moment [1]. In terms of longer range, there has been a demonstration by VLCC that achieved 1kbps transmission of the distance 2km, that is the world's longest distance for VLC. Samsung and ETRI are also active in developing VLC applications. They have demonstrated 120Mbps full duplex mobile-to-mobile transmission and 100Mbps signboard transmission. Please see the following video of Nakagawa lab. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEh5f49LsB4 Widespread use of LEDs in traffic applications and growing interest in Intelligent Transport System (ITS) presents an opportunity for VLC. Data transmission using LED traffic lights, LED road illumination, and LED brake lights are typical application. Dr. Yamazato, the instructor of this tutorial, is a leader in VLC application to ITS and he recently achieved 16kbps data transmission and distance up to 70m in a driving situation with a vehicle moving with 30km/h. Today VLC using LED is a hot topic and VLC projects have been initiated in Europe and US. In 2006 Siemens launched VLC project. Later in 2008, European Commission established OMEGA project with a consortium of 20 European partners from industry and the scientific community [3]. Meanwhile, in 2008, the US National Science Foundation has approved a grant of $18.5 million to help establish and the Engineering Research Center focuses on VLC. The members of the Center include the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, Boston University and the University of New Mexico. The University of California also have launched five-year research project called the Ubiquitous Communication by Light (UC-Light) that is founded with $3.5 million from the University. The project is anticipated to begin in 2009 and run for five years. VLC is in the process of standardization by the IEEE 802.15 TG7 and VLCC as well as other standard organizations. The first VLC specification standard was released from JEITA in conjunction with VLCC in 2007. Later in 2008, VLCC released their first specification standard adopting and expanding the IrDA physical layer. IrDA transceiver transmission wavelength (IrDA physical layer) is expanded to accommodate the visible light wavelength. By adapting this specification, the existing IrDA optical modules can be used for VLCC data transmission with slight modification. In January 2009, IEEE 802.15 (Wireless Personal Area Networks) Task Group 7 (Visible Light Communication) has been launched. At the 6th meeting held in November 2009 they adopted the baseline draft text for the development of the 802.15.7 standard. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce current VLC technology and its trends. Starting with an overview of VLC, participants will learn basics of VLC, on-going standardization activities and VLC.

In this system, all users or passengers are on trains. Thus there is high concentration in user distribution, and a group of the users on a train move to the same direction with the same speed. In such a system, when two opposite trains enter in the same cell before they pass each other, the number of users in the cell abruptly increases, and forced terminations of communication, i.e. call dropping, may occur due to the concentration of traffic. This paper proposes access control methods that mitigate the probability of the dropping, by limiting the number of channels allowed to use on each train dynamically or statically before the two trains enter the same cell. As a result, it is shown that the probability of the forced termination of an existing call can be decreased with the cost of increase in blocking probability. It is also confirmed that the dynamic access control method can inhibit increase of the rejection of newly arrived calls compared to the static access control method when the control duration is enough large.

As advantages using the camera, the recognition of objects as well as their locations can easily be realized and the reception of LED modulated data is also possible at the same time. Unfortunately, if the receiver is far from the transmitter, the received data pattern degrades due to reduction of pixel size and defocusing of the LED data pattern. This paper discusses these problems from image processing approaches. ",Sep. 2009,,,

Thus, it performs well in the time-frequency dispersive channels and is considered to be a promising candidate for the next generation mobile communications modulation scheme.

In order to realize the spectrum sharing, spectrum sensing that detects the presence of a primary user signal is a key technology. For reliable sensing of the primary signal, cooperative sensing where information from multiple sensing nodes is incorporated at a fusion center is currently being investigated by many researchers. Majority of these works consider the imperfectness of the channels between a primary transmitter and sensor nodes under noise and fading environments.

For a cooperative spectrum sensing system, in which the analog outputs of energy detectors at sensor nodes are transmitted to a fusion center, the influence of losses of information from the nodes on detection performance is derived analytically.

We encounter the situation in an intersection where two or more cars are crossing by. Due to the hidden terminal degradation, poor throughput performance is obtained with OFDM scheme. On the other hand, MC-CDMA has a resistance to the hidden terminals as it can support simultaneous packets. However, the transmission data rate is much slow because of the spreading. Thus the total throughput may not be as high as the OFDM. As results, we show that throughput of the OFDM is better than the MC-CDMA in a low traffic region. We found that the OFDM can communicate only with the nearest car. On the contrary, when the traffic is high, the MC-CDMA shows better throughput than the OFDM.

Previously, we have proposed a hierarchical coding scheme which allocated the data to spatial frequency components depending on the priority. In that scheme, the high-priority data can be received even if the receiver was far from the transmitter. We confirmed the advantage of the hierarchical coding scheme, but the bit error performance was not sufficient. In this paper, we divide the data into spatial frequency components, and  use error correcting code for each spatial frequency components\' data. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the improvement in BER performance. This improvement implies that the system range increased compared to the previous method.",Jul. 2008,,,

In a hidden terminal situation, the CSMA scheme may degrade throughput. On the other hand, CDMA slotted ALOHA has a resistance to the hidden terminal situation as it can support simultaneous packets. However, the transmission data rate is much slow because of the spreading. Thus the total throughput may not be as high as the CSMA based OFDM even in a hidden terminal situation. As a result, we show that the CSMA based OFDM system shows better total throughput than CDMA slotted ALOHA in all region. But, only the signal from the nearest car can be received. On the contrary, CDMA slotted ALOHA can be received many packets simultaneously. This is much preferable feature for safety driving.",Jun. 2007,https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2007.4295832,,

In the near future, we will see tens or hundreds of these nodes deployed in town and inside buildings. In such an environment, since many sensor nodes observe a same target or field, the information observed by each sensor node are correlated. Such correlated information are collected at a fusion center. Our purpose is to reduce channel error by using the correlation properties of observed data at the fusion center. Related works on the distributed encoding and joint decoding are the case of two correlated sources. By using the weighted correlation feedback, we extend the iterative joint decoding scheme for the general case where more than two sensor nodes are employed.

These networks can establish multiple routes from a source node to a destination node because of flexible construction of network topology. The transmission by multiple routes has enough capability to achieve reliable communication because we can expect to obtain diversity gain by multiple routes. In this paper, we propose the multi-route coding scheme. At first, we discuss a channel model in multi-hop networks employing regenerative relay, which we named the virtual channel model. By using the virtual channel model, a packet is encoded on multiple routes as follows; a bit sequence of a packet is encoded and divided into subpackets, and each subpacket is transmitted on each route. We evaluate its packet error rate performance, and clarify effectiveness of the proposed scheme. In general, we should face degradation of a route condition such as the case when a subpacket does not reach a destination node. Hence, we have to consider the influence of subpacket loss. We also investigate it, and show tolerance of the proposed scheme over that.",May 2006,,,

In this scheme, multiple replicas of a coded packet are transmitted along different disjoint routes from a source node. These replicas are received, combined and decoded by the destination. If a conventional multipath routing protocol, such as MDSR, is employed, smaller hop routes tend to be selected to transmit packets. However, the performance of MRPC depends on the packet reception probability and the bit error rate of each route. It is therefore expected that the performance mproves if these statics are utilized as a route selection metric. In this paper, we compare the packet error performance of MRPC for different route selection metrics. Three different metrics are considered, that is, the log-likelihood ratio (LLR), the packet reception probability, and the number of hops of a route. From the performance comparison, we show that LLR is the best metric when packet decoding errors are dominant over packet losses. ",Nov. 2005,,,

Due to the possibility of flexible construction in the wireless multi-hop networks, multiple routes from a source node to a destination node can be established. In this paper, we propose the route coding scheme in the wireless multi-hop networks. In the proposed scheme, a packeted data sequence is encoded by the convolutional code at the source node. Each digit of the code word is assigned to sub-packets on multiple routes. At the intermediate nodes, the sub-packets are regenerated-relayed to the next node. The sub-packets transmitted via multiple routes are decoded by the Viterbi decoder with the modified metric computation at the destination node. We also evaluate the system performance, and clarify the improvement of the packet error rate by the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the route loss due to topological change or recognizing failure.",Jun. 2005,,,

In a CDMA Unslotted ALOHA system, Multiple Access Interference (MAI) may  bring about error in PR/CA. The MAI mainly stems from already recognized packets and newly arriving packets under the execution of PR/CA. This characteristic of asynchronous transmission in CDMA U-ALOHA systems implies that only one or a few packets arrive at the receiver within a short interval of a execution. Furthermore, newly arriving packets are recognized and code-acquired by using a short preamble part. Consequently, the MAI from the packets under the execution of the PR/CA will be small. Focusing on that point, this paper proposes applying the IC scheme in order to suppress the MAI from the already recognized and code-acquired packets. A performance evaluation demonstrates that such an application is valid due to the small amount of MAI from the packets under the execution of PR/CA. In addition, we demonstrates that the scheme reduces false recognition rather than mis-recognition. Such a scheme improves the performance of not only PR/CA, but also the throughput.",Jun. 2005,,,

B3G systems should provide services comparable to those offered by wired networks for a variety of applications such as interactive multimedia, VoIP (voice over Internet protocol), network games, videoconferencing, etc. The current trend is that B3G will be based on IP technology, and therefore, all-IP [1] architecture design has been an important research topic in the past few years. Those systems will need to support multiple services ubiquitously in different types of environment including indoor, outdoor (with low and high velocity), and up to global broadband access (satellite). Thus, they would be deployed in a heterogeneous environment of various physical access networks of wireless and wired systems. The network heterogeneity means that the physical access network underlying the B3G system will support different levels of data rates and different mobility and traffic management techniques govern individual systems. In this context, the B3G mobile systems will face at least two predominant constraints: a) heterogeneity in physical access network, and b) change of application types from commonly low data rates into more bandwidth demanding real-time and multimedia ones. In such situation, providing quality of service to users would become even more difficult that what we are currently dealing. One of the main issues involved in the development of B3G systems is the choice of multiple access (MA) technology that could efficiently share the available bandwidth to large number of users. The choice of MA technique could significantly enhance or damage the service quality delivered to end users. It is known that the existing MA techniques used in 2G/3G systems, including those based on time division multiple access (TDMA) and direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) [2], and other combinations of the two schemes are basically suitable for voice communications and not for the burst data traffic, which would be the dominant portion of traffic load in B3G systems. Therefore, the need for developing new MA techniques for B3G becomes imperative. In this article, we will review the main technical concepts of the MA schemes in wireless mobile systems and try to find the path for the development of an appropriate MA scheme for B3G through those fundamentals govern the existing MA schemes. In the following section, multiple access technologies will be reviewed from historical and technical points of view. This review will be followed by a section that provides simple formulization of MA schemes through mathematical expressions that could simplify the process of developing new MA schemes for B3G wireless cellular systems. We will then list the most important features of multiple access schemes in 3G mobile system. Finally we conclude this article by reviewing the most promising MA schemes for B3G mobile systems.",Feb. 2005,,,

In this paper, we propose two novel inter-period correlation processing (IPCP) receivers for UWB impulse radar. The conventional IPCP receiver uses the signal periodicity of signals, so it avoids estimation of unknown parameters determined by the targets and propagation. However, its accuracy of measurement is poor because the time resolution is restricted to a signal periodicity. We propose a parallel IPCP receiver to improve accuracy. When there are multiple targets, the conventional IPCP receiver needs multiple thresholds to detect. This results in complexity of the receiver. So, we propose a parallel differential IPCP receiver.

One of the important and interesting techniques for multi-hop networks is a multi-path routing. By using the multi-path routing, multiple routes from a source node to a destination node can be established. In this paper, we propose the error correcting and diversity combiner scheme on multiple routes in wireless multi-hop networks to reduce bit errors. The diversity combiner outputs the likelihood information from the packets transmitted via multiple routes. By feeding the likelihood information into the Viterbi decoder, the diversity gain can be obtained. We evaluate the packet error rate and the total traffic. As a result, the packet error rate can be improved. Furthermore, the total traffic can be reduced in the low Eb/N0 in spite of the traffic increase due to transmission via redundant routes.",Sep. 2004,,,

Some works have been done about discovering the received signal-power distribution which makes MAI be suppressed effectively. This distribution minimizes the averaged Bit Error Rate(BER). However, in packet communication systems, it is dominant to the performance if packets can be transmitted successfully or not. Even if the averaged BER is high, many packets can be correctly transmitted. It implies that the optimum distribution on averaged BER does not give the best performance of packet transmission.In this paper, the received signal-power distribution which gives the best performance of packet transmission is derived. Such a distribution will make clear the limit of performance improvement using SIC.",Sep. 2004,,,

In this case, however, packet errors caused by a channel may lead to a loss of transmitted information directly. Then, it is necessary to employ a technique which can reduce the influence of packet errors. We propose to employ a multiple-route packet combining scheme in real-time communications on wireless multihop networks. The scheme can achieve a diversity gain by combining multiple copies of the same packet that are transmitted along different routes. We analyze two characteristics of the proposed system. One is the average packet error probability, which is obtained as a function of elapsed time after transmission requests for copied packets are generated. The other is the required time for achieving a required packet error probability. The results are evaluated from a quality of service (QoS) point of view. From numerical results, it is shown that for a given tolerable delay, there exists a number of multiple routes that minimizes the achievable average packet error probability. Moreover, if the number of multiple routes is selected appropriately, the required time for achieving a required packet error probability can be minimized.",Sep. 2004,,,

The adaptive interleaving is a method that assigns symbols adaptively to the subcarriers in order to cope with frequency selective fading based on a channel state information (CSI) sent back from the reception end. The concept of adaptive interleaving is to maximize a free Euclidean distance in the limited interleave size. In this paper, we extend the method by an introduction of bit interleaving and multiple trellis coded modulation (MTCM). MTCM assigns two or more symbols to one trellis branch and shows good performance in frequency selective fading. If we could assign those set of symbols with an aid of the adaptive interleaving, the performance improvement can be expected. Another improvement method considered in this paper is the use of bit interleaving. The bit interleaving techniques randomize the effect of channel more efficiently compared to the case of symbols interleaving. Thus the further performance improvement is expected. One draw back is that since the interleaving process is done in bit level, bit interleaving can not be applied to TCM nor MTCM. In this paper, we mainly focus on adaptive bit and symbol interleaving and discuss the  performance from the point of interleaving effect, and the error  correcting code (convolutional code and MTCM).",Jun. 2003,,,

We demonstrate our proposed method using the turbo code in which soft information is required for decoding. As a result, the simulation shows slight difference in the range of moderate to high signal-to-noise ratio between the proposed decoding scheme and the conventional turbo decoding scheme. Moreover, the bit error rate of 10-11 can be achieved by serial concatenation of a Reed-Solomon code and a turbo code for Q-factor lower than 8.0 dB with a bandwidth expansion ratio of 33.3%.",Mar. 2003,,,

We have proposed the CDMA unslotted ALOHA system using an adaptive filter receiver based on minimum mean square error criterion in [8], and shown the improvement in the throughput performance even considering the effect of birth/death event. The ensemble-averaged squared error, however, increases at the point of packet birth. In this paper, we employ interleaving and forward error correction (FEC) coding techniques to mitigate the momentary increase in ensemble-averaged squared error. The use of FEC, however, causes the increase in MAI due to redundancy bits of FEC. Moreover, signal power is reduced under the condition that the energy of an  information bit is the same.

This modification was proposed for the purpose of a further reduction in the algorithm's computational weight in case of receiving sufficiently resolvable waves. Specifically, we found that short interval windows are sufficient for estimating delays and azimuth angles, which is quite effective in reducing the computational burden in their optimization processes. As for the estimation of the attenuation parameters, a longer time window, equal to the preamble length, is considered for more accurate estimation. Also two other estimators are proposed. The first one combining the modified SAGE with a sequential estimation of the attenuation parameters, suitable for slowly varying channels. Another one, similar to the first, and primarily designed to alleviate the influence of present strong interferers.

It is shown that m-HPSK outperforms HPSK in the presence of non-linear amplification.",Sep. 2000,,,

Since the signals have large amplitude fluctuations in conventional OFDM systems, signals amplified by a non-linear amplifier are greatly distorted, resulting  in severe performance degradation. In order to avoid this large amplitude fluctuation, we propose a scheme for reducing the non-linear distortion by using the set of the signal point series which show low Peak-to-Mean-Envelope-Power-Ratio (PMEPR) value.

In terrestrial systems,  the power of a received desired/interfering signal is mainly determined by the propagation loss, which is often modeled to be proportional to the fourth power of the propagation distance. On the contrary, in satellite systems, the loss varies as the square of distance and, in addition to the loss, the gain of the beam also affects the interference power. Because of this  difference, the superiority or inferiority of multiple access schemes discussed terrestrial systems may not be adopted for satellite systems.

In this paper, we clarify the effect of long time delay on the performance of CDMA ALOHA systems and then propose a new access control protocol, called Modified Channel Load Sensing Protocol (MCLSP), for the CDMA ALOHA systems.

We also clarify the stability of the system. Based on these results, we propose the optimal retransmission control (ORC) to improve the performances. The ORC is the scheme to prevent the system from drifting to an undesirable operating point by controlling the birth rate of retransmitted packets. As a result, it is shown that the throughput and delay performances of the system with the ORC are better than without the ORC and the system does not drift to an undesirable operating point.
